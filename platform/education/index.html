                We believe that education is a right, not a privilege, and all children should be able to attend school and have a safe space to learn without having to worry about personal issues such as funds. The current education system has fundamental flaws, and we aim to significantly improve the effectiveness of teaching. We will strive to drastically increase staff hiring and funds for schools and extracurriculars, so that teachers have better resources to teach with, and teacher to student ratios are improved. The current education system leaves many adults unprepared for their lives, with the United States having one of the worst literacy rates for a country with its level of development. 55 percent of adults in the United States have a literacy rate of below a sixth grade level. There is also a large dropoff in literacy for women and people living in poverty, which is unacceptable on a moral and humanitarian level.  Children are our nation’s future, and they should get the education they deserve and need—as should any adult who has not completed a full education or wishes to increase their level of knowledge.
