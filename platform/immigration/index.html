                Our goal with immigration as a party is to improve the immigration system by securing the border and making sure the immigration system is more efficient, so that people that wish to enter the United States can enter legally, with the ability to vote, and with all rights that a human being should have. We also aim to better inform the public of the United States on the exact process an immigrant goes through and how to support them as much as possible to grow and strengthen the community. This will make the country safer for the people in it and those around the country, regardless of where they come from, who they are, and what their story is, because every person deserves a chance. We will achieve this by increasing resources for the USCIS to speed up and improve the immigration process, processing people who are currently undocumented to grant them citizenship and the rights that come with it, funding social programs to inform the current population about how to support immigrants, and providing jobs for new immigrants in a variety of fields.
