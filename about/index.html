            The Rose Party is an 8th grade party focused solely on defense of the environment and economy. The rose represents elegance with its beautiful petals, but ability to defend itself with its sharp thorns. This sums up the Rose Party’s goals as well; elegance and defense all in one. We believe that no matter the cost, we will protect people’s rights, solving crime spikes and rising taxes, while also protecting the balance of nature, helping with global warming and climate change. However, we are not monsters who take everything for ourselves to fix only our problems; we focus on selflessness and helping others above all else.
