            <p style="color: #e8eded;">To the sigmas of Australia, I say that this goofy ahh government have been capping, not just now but for a long time. A few of you may remember when they said, ‘There’ll be no fanum tax under the government I lead.’ They’re capaholics. They’re also yapaholics. They yap non-stop about how their cost-of-living measures are changing lives for all Australians. Just put the fries in the bag, lil bro. They tell us that they’re locked in on improving the housing situation in this country. They must have brain rot from watching too much Kai Cenat and forgot about their plans to ban social media for kids under 14. If that becomes law, you can ‘forgor skull emoji’ all about watching Duke Dennis or catching a dub with the bros on Fort. Chat, is this Prime Minister serious? Even though he’s the Prime Minister of Australia, sometimes it feels like he’s the CEO of Ohio. I would be taking an L if I did not mention the opps who want to cut WA’s gyatts and services tax. The decision voters will be making in a few months time will be between a mid government, a dog water opposition or a crossbench that will mog both of them. Though some of you cannot yet vote, I hope that, when you do, it will be in a more goated Australia for a government with more aura. Skibidi!</p>

            <h2>About the Rose Party</h2>
            <p>The Rose Party is one of the 8th-grade political parties which is focused heavily on the defense of environment and economy of the American people. Our rose represents our heart with its beautiful petals, and our bold and strong resolve, firm, undisturbed with its sharp thorns. This sums up the goals of the Rose Party as well; empathy and defense with no comprimise in either. No matter the cost, we will protect people’s rights by not just adressing crime spikes and rising taxes, but taking action. While also protecting the balance of nature and working towards fixing the issues that are global warming and climate change. We will not gatekeep everything for ourselves only to address the issues we face, but the issues we as a country face together. We will stand strong when others are hopeless and look to selflessness and help everyone, above all else.</p>
